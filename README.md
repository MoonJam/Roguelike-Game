# Roguelike-Game
My first attempts at any kind of game-making. The sprites I'm using were created by Robert Norenburg over at http://0x72.pl/.

## Progress
At this point, I've set up the beginnings of an ECS and have done a bit of drawing to the screen to test the waters. User input is accepted and I can get a character to move around on screen. My next goal is to make certain tiles navigable (or not) and from there be able to randomly generate rooms and connect them via hallways.

Once these things are in place, I'll start worrying about adding anything other than the player character!
