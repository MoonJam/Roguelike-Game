# Roguelike-Game
My first attempts at any kind of game-making. The sprites I'm using were created by Robert Norenburg over at http://0x72.pl/.

## Progress
At this point, I've set up the beginnings of an ECS and have done a bit of drawing to the screen to test the waters. User input is accepted and I can get a character to move around on screen. Currently, the sprites are accessed through an annoying catalog of filepaths (housed in a zipped archive in this repository). My next goals are as follows:

* Rework the sprite-catalog system: it is currently very annoying to work with and I have barely done anything!
* Make certain tiles navigable versus not.
* Set up random room generation.
* Set up random room connection through hallways.

Once these things are in place, I'll start worrying about adding anything other than the player character!
